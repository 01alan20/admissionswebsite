# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

View your app in AI Studio: https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1DhDeCYfBgd-BDLf51g6c84ZlIE53hY_8

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. (Optional) AI summaries are disabled by default. If you later enable them, set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in an `.env.local` and wire a client — not required for this build.
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`
